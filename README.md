# Project 3 - Kinect Hacking

## Software

We used Processing 2 with SimpleOpenNI on OS X.

## Project Description

We developed a game where mustaches are drawn onto each player’s face and scale depending on the player’s distance from the sensor. Each player is equipped with a razor that can be used to shave the mustache. The environment reminds of a bathroom mirror.
